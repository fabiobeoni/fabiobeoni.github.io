Ideally, the team should be involved throughout the process (e.g. preparatory steps, implementation of the training, and monitoring and evaluation activities following the training). Here are some of the key tasks of the training team: </span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Review together this learning guide prior to the training, to gain a full and common understanding of the programme. </li>
                                <li>Gather knowledge and skills related to the governance of tenure (e.g. tenure issues in country, legal negotiation, tenure reform processes) and on facilitation. </li>
                                <li>Define in advance the roles and responsibilities for each session. </li>
                                <li>Make a list of what has to be prepared in advance, the materials needed, and the timing. </li>
                            </ul><span>What about support staff? Support staff should be available full time for at least three days before the training begins, as they will play a critical role in preparing the training materials, photocopying documents, and helping the facilitator(s) during the training. In addition, a staff member or consultant should take care of documentation, take notes and photos during the training, type up outputs as needed during the training, and prepare the training report. </span></div>

                                <li><strong>Size and location:</strong> The geographic location of the venue as well as the actual physical space such as the size and layout of the room can significantly influence the outcome of the training. The training
                                    venue should have a large hall with lots of space for the participants to move around. Ideally, the capacity of the room should be approximately double the number of participants. It would be important to have places
                                    where 3 or 4 smaller groups of roughly 5–6 people each can meet separately for group work. Alternatively, more than one room might be needed. </li>
                                <li><strong>Room layout:</strong> Chairs should be easily movable and arranged in a ‘U’ shape with no tables in front of chairs, with only 3 or 4 tables behind the U against the walls, or alternatively with small tables for
                                    6 to 8 people for the working sessions. There should be a small table for the LCD projector. The facilitator and the training team should ideally sit with participants in the ‘U’, or at one small table close to the
                                    participants. Should this not be possible, the facilitator should avoid sitting behind a big table at the front.&nbsp; </li>
                                <li><strong>Wall space:</strong> Ideally, there should be large white boards or chalk boards. If boards are not available, thereshould be lots of wall space for placing things on the wall </li>

                                <li><strong>Adapt and prepare the materials:</strong> Review the materials related to the sessions, adapt them to the training context, and decide which materials should be distributed as hard copies to the participants. A
                                    translation into the local language might be needed when the participants do not master the language of the materials. Make sure there are enough copies of materials for each participant, and ensure that materials are
                                    photocopied, stapled and put where they can be easily retrieved for the appropriate session. Preferably, do not give out all materials at once. </li>
                                <li><strong>Buy materials following a checklist:</strong> It is important to buy materials carefully and in advance, especially if the venue is a long way from shops. A materials checklist is provided below. This should be
                                    adapted to local names for materials, printed out and used by the person doing the purchasing. Because the training involves group exercises using cards and big sheets of paper, a lot of materials may be needed, so
                                    it is always good to overestimate if the number of participants is uncertain. </li>
                                <li>Allocate time and location for preparing materials. Many big posters have to be prepared before the training. You should prepare them all before the training starts. Refer to the <a href="assets/docs/training_materials_checklist.pdf"

            <h3>Tips and comments</h3>
            <p>1. The training organizers should begin preparations approximately 1–1.5 months prior to the training. Consider that a full understanding of this learning guide and of the proposed methodology may require some additional time.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Other key factors that may have an impact on the time needed include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The level of familiarity of the facilitator with the Voluntary Guidelines, the tenure situation of the country, and the tenure-related processes at national and local levels. </li>
                <li> The need to adapt the training material to the local context, including to translate the training material into local language(s). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Carry out a careful assessment of these elements before starting the preparation, to plan realistically for the work that needs to be done in preparation for the training. </p>
            <p>2. Allow one day for rehearsal: talking through and practising each session brings the guide to life and helps the team to think through the process and ensure that all the materials are in place.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>3. Remember to provide participants with a copy of the VGGT during the training. In addition, all participants should either bring or be supplied with notebooks and pens to use throughout the workshop. </p>
